Formal Requirements: SnickerSync
Goal:
To evaluate user engagement and efficiency when using the SnickerSync diff tool compared to traditional diff tools.
Non-goal:
To replace or deprecate existing diff tools in the GiggleGit ecosystem.
Non-functional requirements:
Security and Access Control:
The SnickerSync tool must enforce role-based access control to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and modify core snickering concepts and user study data.
Randomized User Assignment:
The system must support randomized assignment of users to control groups and variant groups for unbiased user studies.
Functional requirements:
For Security and Access Control:
1.1 User Authentication:
The system shall require users to authenticate using their GiggleGit credentials before accessing the SnickerSync tool.
1.2 Role-based Permissions:
The system shall provide different levels of access based on user roles:
Regular users can only use the SnickerSync tool for diff operations
PMs have additional permissions to modify snickering concepts
Researchers have access to anonymized user study data
For Randomized User Assignment:
2.1 Automatic Group Assignment:
Upon a user's first interaction with SnickerSync, the system shall automatically assign the user to either a control group (using the vanilla interface) or a variant group (using the SnickerSync interface) using a randomization algorithm.
2.2 Group Tracking:
The system shall maintain a record of each user's group assignment (control or variant) throughout the duration of the user study, ensuring consistent experiences across multiple sessions.
